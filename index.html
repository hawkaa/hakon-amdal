                        Supervisor in genus wants to add what i like to call "sub-otpmizations" based on gut feeling, but we need some theory.
                        Honestly, dont think he is pretty satisfied me the fall. And he is quite stubborn.
                        Use the entire fall semester to write him a 90 page long argument of why I am right and he is wrong.
                        To my great surprise, he read it, he learnt from it.
                        "Lets just replace the entire storage engine and data representation in GENUS"
                        Remember that this is a mature product that has been on the market for a while with tons of technical debt.

                        So we go on and change the built-in row-store in the platform with a column store. Which was very inefficient.
                        A lot of pointers, and overhead since all values are stored in heap-allocated classes.
                        We use all the tricks from state of the art atabase technology and apply compression.
                        We also implement operations that exploit the column structure

                        I remember telling bratsberg in january that I was hoping for 1000x times improvement for some operations.
                        He was like "okay, sure", clearly not having faith in me.
                        But what you know: Reduction from 55 seconds to 25 milliseconds. This was for finding all transactions less than a certain value.

                        Undoubtedly, my volunteer work has given me a great network. I know a lot of people at computer science,
                        not only in my class, but across all classes. Also in Informatics.
                        I've also made lots of contacts in business. For instance, I met Genus though Abakus and pushed them to
                        get up to us and show them how its like to be a non-consultant. People loved it. I gave them the opportunity to connect with
                        students in trondheim. And it ended up for me getting the opportunity for an awesome master thesis.

                    <aside class="notes">
                        One of my favourite words: Serendipity. It was actually voted the hardest word to translate in 2004.
                        It means somehing like "finding out things witout being in search of them". for instanc, something really small event than might change your life.
                        Had several occations of serendipity:
                        - Landed my first job as a system developer in 2008 by saying yes to help out with bicycle race timing services
                        - Found about Schibsted technologies by dropping by a friend when I actually was really tired and wanted to go home.
                       And here is where the "yes"-man comes in. These things happens because you say yes! Saying yes means you get to meet a lot of new people and getting challenged with things that might change your life

                        In my opinion, everyone should study abroad.
                        I might have missed this, but I havent seen IDI encourage this.
                        I would like to see specific recommended schools in the different regions for students at IDI.

                        But there are much more to benefit from collaboration.
                        - Abakus knows its students and what they want
                        - Abakus knows the business community and can help put you in contact with them
                        - etc.
